# â–‰ Game-Of-Life

A basic implementation of Conway's Game of Life, that runs in the terminal. 
This project was inspired (and helped along) by Robert Heaton's [blog](https://robertheaton.com/2018/07/20/project-2-game-of-life/).

By default it generates a random soup which runs indefinitely, but it can be adjusted to take a seed and run it instead. Some seeds included here are the beacon, glider, toad, pulsar, and Gospar glider gun.
